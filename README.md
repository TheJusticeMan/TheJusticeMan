## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Developer** who knows **vanilla JavaScript backwards and forwards**—from the basics to the intricate quirks, I love working close to the metal (or the browser, really).

But there's more: I'm also a **writer, carpenter, and actor**. Whether I'm building something with code or with my hands, storytelling and craftsmanship are at the heart of everything I do.

## ✍️ Writer & Actor
