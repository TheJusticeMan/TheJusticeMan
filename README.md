## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## **Hey, Iâ€™m Justice!**

I like **building things**, whether itâ€™s **code, music, or something unexpected**. Iâ€™ve always had a habit of taking things apart just to see how they workâ€”sometimes putting them back together, sometimes making something completely new.

#### **What I Do**

- **Coding:** Built a **Bible app** with AI-powered cross-referencing. Also made a **custom 3D engine** that renders **4 billion stars** (because why not?).
- **Music:** I produce **EDM instrumentals**, blending techno with dance vibes. Check out **KKBZ** and **Epic Bitcrush** if youâ€™re into that kind of thing.
- **Experimenting:** AI, game engines, home serversâ€”whatever gets my curiosity going.

### **Current Projects**

- Teaching my **Bible AI** to learn from user input (but locally, because privacy matters).
- Refining my **music brand** and YouTube content.
- Considering upgrading my setup with a **home server** for AI experiments.

### **Fun Fact**

As a kid, I reverse-engineered **WAV and BMP files** just to figure out how sound and images work. No internet, just trial and error.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Languages & Tools:** Kotlin, JavaScript, AI/ML, Android Studio, 3D graphics.
- **Music Gear:** FL Studio Mobile, MIDI keyboards, and whatever sounds good.
